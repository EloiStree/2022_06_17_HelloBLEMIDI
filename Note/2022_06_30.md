Ok...

So what I understand.

- ESP32 can't do easily BluetoothToSerial like HC06-HC05
- ESP32 us BLE that is only readable by UWP
- NAudio works for Midi in C# classic and so can't access UWP ESP32 BLE and so midi by bluetooth.

- If you want to do it the old way, you need the HC06.
  - If oyu want to do it the new way, you are obliged to use a converter of BLE to N in UWP (or else like pYthon)



The old way should be as simple as a serial port:
``` cpp
//This example code is in the Public Domain (or CC0 licensed, at your option.)
//By Evandro Copercini - 2018
//
//This example creates a bridge between Serial and Classical Bluetooth (SPP)
//and also demonstrate that SerialBT have the same functionalities of a normal Serial

#include "BluetoothSerial.h"

#if !defined(CONFIG_BT_ENABLED) || !defined(CONFIG_BLUEDROID_ENABLED)
#error Bluetooth is not enabled! Please run `make menuconfig` to and enable it
#endif

#if !defined(CONFIG_BT_SPP_ENABLED)
#error Serial Bluetooth not available or not enabled. It is only available for the ESP32 chip.
#endif

BluetoothSerial SerialBT;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  SerialBT.begin("ESP32test"); //Bluetooth device name
  Serial.println("The device started, now you can pair it with bluetooth!");
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available()) {
    SerialBT.write(Serial.read());
  }
  if (SerialBT.available()) {
    Serial.write(SerialBT.read());
  }
  delay(20);
}

```





Note, the Arduino I bought are BLE and Wifi.
There are lib like Adafruit IO Arduino Library that allows to see info from distance without to much configuration.
Should I do a module for Adafruit IO to OMI later in the dev to allow wifi input without having to use MQTT necesserally.
Does Arduino 33 and feather can communicate to MQTT directly ?
Should I explore that in a next hackathon:
