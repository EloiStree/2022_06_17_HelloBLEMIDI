Ok...

So what I understand.

- ESP32 can't do easily BluetoothToSerial like HC06-HC05
- ESP32 us BLE that is only readable by UWP
- NAudio works for Midi in C# classic and so can't access UWP ESP32 BLE and so midi by bluetooth.

- If you want to do it the old way, you need the HC06.
  - If oyu want to do it the new way, you are obliged to use a converter of BLE to N in UWP (or else like pYthon)
